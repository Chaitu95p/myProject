Apache Pig:
----------

* Pig is a layer on top of MapReduce Framework. 
* Yahoo developed Pig to overcome/abstracts the complexity of MapReduce programming.
* Pig is a Open source "Data flow language".
* Pig Latin scripting.
* Pig converts the scripts into a sequence of MapReduce jobs.

-->  Similar to SQL syntax.

* Pig is not best fit for Video, Audio, etc.,
* Pig lacks in flow control(loops,case stmsts...)

* Save pig scripts with .pig extension (but .pig is not mandatory, but we need to follow industry standards).
