4 Pillars of Hadoop Security:-

  1) Authentication with Kerberos
  2) Authorization using Sentry, ACL
  3) HDFS encryption using Java KMS
  4) Auditing & Lineage (Using Cloudera Navigator)

** BDR ---> Cloudera Backup and Disaster Recovery
            Available only with a Cloudera Enterprise license.
            
Pre-requisites for Installing CDH cluster:  (Just config files mentioned. Watch 2nd video for detailed info)
  -- /etc/rc.local  (To disable transparent huge pages)
  -- /etc/sysctl.conf   (Change VM swappinnes)
  -- Disable firewall
  -- Disable SELinux
  -- /etc/sysconfig/network .............  Watch Video
  
  -- /etc/yum.repos.d 
  
** Need to know about password less authentication between cluster nodes.

Imp Commands:
-----------

$ yum repolist
$ vgdisplay
$ yum -y install <Required-command>     (Used to insatll any linux command)
$ yum list all
$ yum clean all   (To clear previous cache)
$ yum makecache   (To update latest cache file)
$ authconfig-tui

$ mysql -u <username> -p

Centralized Authentication used in hadoop servers (cluster):-
-----------------------------------------------------------

-- Hadoop cluster is nothing but a group of servers/machines/nodes. So each server is having an OS(It can be RHEL/CentOS/windows etc.,).
   So each OS is having a different authentication mechanism. We can create user in each server in the cluster and we can work. 
   Here the main problem will arise when we implement Kerberos authentication. In Kerberos authentication the same user should be 
   present in all the servers. If it's a 1000 nodes cluster then it'll be a problem to create a same user in all 1000 nodes manually. 
-- To overcome this problem we can use either Active Directory (LDAP + Kerberos) or OpenLDAP.
   LDAP is a protocal. 
   
   * AD or OpenLDAP implemented server will be integrated with all the servers in the cluster. 
     When a new user wants access to hadoop cluster, Simply admins will create a user in AD or OpenLDAP implemented server. 
     With that created credentials that user can login into hadoop cluster based on assigned groups. 
     Here no need to create user in each and every server in the cluster.
   
   * If AD is used, then to ingrate with unix/linux boxes in the cluster we need 3rd party softwares 
     like Centrify, Quest authentication, SSSD etc.,
     
   * php LDAP admin is a GUI tool to create users and groups.
   
   
***********  LDAP URL = ldaps://ctlldapodc.ctl.intranet:636 (Check in HUE configuration in CM)

Adding new host to CDH cluster using Cloudera Manager


Cloudera Kerberization:-
----------------------

$ yum install krb5-server krb5-libs krb5-workstation

edit /etc/krb5.conf file with kdc server name name 

$ kdb5_util create -s

** Installion & configuration of MIT kerberos KDC server and Kerberizing CDH cluster using cloudera manager

- Select any one server in the cluster as MIT kerberos server.
https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDF3/HDF-3.3.0/enabling-kerberos/content/(optional)_install_a_new_mit_kdc.html

Note: We know how to install & configure MIT kerberos server and how to integrate that kerberos with our cluster using cloudera manager.
----  Once it's done how to access cluster.

Kerberos principal and keytab creation

ticket-granting ticket (tgt)

** Anyone who need root privilege need to copy root.keytab file and place it somewhere securely and find out 
   the principal name of root user.

$ kinit -kt <keytab file> <principal name>

Q) Which tgt you own?
   $ klist
Q) To destroy/clean tgt?
   $ kdestroy


Sentry:-
------

Sentry is just for authorization ( setting up proper permission for users)
-- We can control hive and impala databases, tables, coloums etc.,
-- We can define who can access hive/impala database objects.

Kerberos is one of the pre-requisite for Sentry.

Configuration of Sentry for Hive authorization
