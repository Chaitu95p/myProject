•	Coding Efficiency			In Developers Hand
•	Configuration Properties		In Admin Hands
•	Cluster Hardware		 	In Infrastructure Team Hands

 	No.of Containers = No.of tasks we can able to run in parallel.

Eg: 48 Containers means, we’ve a capacity of running 48 tasks in parallel.

256 GB Ram in Node	=	32 GB for Linux OS + 32 GB for HBase + 64 GB for Impala + Rest of the RAM i.e,. 128 GB ram for YARN.

24 Cores 	 48 Vcores	48 Containers

•	In general all nodes have same configurations in the cluster.
